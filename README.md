# _Marmo Twitter Bot_

#### _Python project to respond to Twitter searches for songs from the Marmoset catalog._

#### By _**Moof Mayeda**_

## Description

_This Twitter Bot replies to any tweet with the hashtag #marmomood. It searches for matches with tags on songs in the Marmoset catalog, like "upbeat" or "electronic." It then returns the top ranked song matching those criteria, with a link to play it on the Marmoset website. If no matches are found, it searches song titles and artist names and returns the top ranked match. Finally, if there are still no results, it returns one of the top 10 Marmoset songs at random._
